\chapter{Conclusion}\label{chap:conclusion}

In conclusion, we can see that this approach solves the problem of the infinite executions, which other approaches do not solve. This approach also solves the problems that other approaches do solve, like deadlocks.

We can see that this execution order solves some of the problems that are not solved byt he other execution orders.
