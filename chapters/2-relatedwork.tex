Give a brief overview of the work relevant for your thesis.

This thesis is building up from the paper ``Better eager than lazy'' \cite{bolander2018better} from my advisors. In this paper, they researched how a lazy agent, who had a preference against doing its own actions, compares to eager agents in planning problems.
