How would it be if we had a perfect execution order? \\

This thesis is trying to answer that question by looking at the different execution orders. In other pieces of writing about epistemic planning the execution order is a seemingly random one, usually unclear. This is easier to describe mathematically, but it also has some drawbacks. My thesis is trying to take these games and transform them into a game with a token. As you will see, this will have some advantages.

There are four different execution modes that are possible:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Asynchronous \\
    The agents move in a seemingly random order.
  \item Concurrent \\
    The agents can act at the same time.
  \item token based \\
    The agents need a special token to be able to act, only one agent has the token at a time.
  \item round robin \\
    The agents act one agent after the other, after the last agent is done they begin with the first agent again.
\end{enumerate}
We have found that the token based orders are a subset of the asynchronous orders, because all token based orders can also be ``a random'' asynchronous order, but not all asynchronous orders are a token based order. Also all round robin orders can be token based orders by accident, but not all token based orders are a round robin order.

Because of this we only looked at token based orders in this thesis.

``Epistemic planning is the enrichtment of planning with epistemic notions, that is, knowledge and belief.''

Epistemic planning is taking regular planning and enriching it with knowledge and belief. In regular planning, the world is simplified so that everyone knows everything there is to know about that particular microverse. But this is not the real world. In the real world, agents ofthen have only little knowledge and can therefore make only limited calculations on that world. To model that, we use epistemic logic.
